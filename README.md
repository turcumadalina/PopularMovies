# Opti-Movies

Old name: **Popular Movies**

Here is a fully functional and user friendly android app which I made from scratch for [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) program.

This app helps users to discover various categorised **Movies** and **TV Shows**. It reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.It includes various new Lollipop+ features.

The app was highly evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer and was graded as **"Exceeds Specifications"**.
